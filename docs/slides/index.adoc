== Project Overview

=== What is the E2E Encrypted Messenger?

A self-hosted messenger with end-to-end encryption that prioritizes privacy and security. The application offers:

=== Features of E2E Encrypted Messenger

* **Complete end-to-end encryption** of all message contents
* **Self-hosting capability** for full control over your data
* **Modern web interface** with responsive design
* **Contact management system** with friend requests
* **Local message storage** for offline access

== Technology Stack

=== Frontend
* Vue.js 3 with Composition API
* TypeScript for type-safe development
* Tailwind CSS for modern UI design
* Vite as build tool and development server
* WebSocket for real-time message transmission
* libsodium for client-side cryptography

=== Backend
* Node.js with Express
* TypeScript for type-safe API development
* PostgreSQL for data storage
* JWT for authentication
* Docker for easy deployment and containerization

=== Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

* **Client (Frontend)**: Encrypts messages before sending and decrypts received messages locally
* **Server (Backend)**: Stores only encrypted messages and forwards them to the correct recipients
* **Database**: Stores user accounts, contacts, and encrypted messages

=== Security Concept

* **Key exchange**: Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange
* **Message encryption**: Symmetric encryption for message contents
* **Zero-knowledge**: The server has no access to unencrypted message contents
* **Local key storage**: Private keys never leave the user's device
